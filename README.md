# Flow-of-Options: Diversified and Improved LLM Reasoning by Thinking Through Options
Flow-of-Options (FoO) is a novel reasoning approach designed to overcome intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) that limit the diversity of their outputs. Broadly, FoO is a network datastructure that explicitly enumerates options for each step in the task, as nodes in the network. Through its formulation, FoO forces the LLM to be aware of, and to explore, a broader spectrum of possibilities for completing the task, **without** any pre-training or fine-tuning. FoO leads to improved performances compared to state-of-the-art baselines, as demonstrated through an FoO-based agentic system for autonomously solving Machine Learning tasks (AutoML).
