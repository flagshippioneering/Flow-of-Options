# Flow-of-Options
Flow-of-Options (FoO) is a novel reasoning framework designed to address intrinsic biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) that limit the diversity of their outputs. FoO expands the scope of the LLM's reasoning during inference, to enforce diversity in its outputs without the need for any pre-training or fine-tuning. FoO leads to improved performances compared to state-of-the-art baselines, as demonstrated through an FoO-based agentic system for autonomously solving Machine Learning tasks (AutoML).
